-an ARM Assembly Language program where you count the number of flashes

-green, get ready
-blue, count flashes
-red, stop counting
-orange, press button for number of flashes
-if all lights flash, proceed, otherwise if red+orange stay on, failure

-my first time dealing with interrupts, so I had help with the definitions.s file, and the setup of the game.s file
